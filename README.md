# pymon-pi
A small python script for raspberry's temperature monitoring with notifications.

Small Abstract:
This application will constantly monitor the raspberry's temperature.
If the temperature will be too high (es: 80Â°) for a long time (es: 1-5 minutes) it will send an email to the proprietary.
If the temperature will be too high for more than 10 minutes, it will send the email and shutdown it.

In order to create this application i think i will use:
- SQLite as local DBMS
- Python scripting language
- Brain
